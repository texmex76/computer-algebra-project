# CA Project: Modular GCD Algorithm

Repository for our Computer Algebra project.

## Project statement

1. Examine in detail the theory at the basis of modular GCD computations.
2. Implement a modular GCD algorithm for integers.
3. Adapt your program to modular GCD-computation of multivariate polynmials over $\mathbb{Q}$.
